            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a motivated student whoâ€™s just finished his second year of a Bachelor of science with an honors specialization in computer science. Although I currently do not have much experience in the field, I am passionate about learning as much as possible about software development</p>
            <h3> About this page </h3>
            <p> This is the webpage I'm doing for CS50's 'Unit 8' assignment. It is the home page, linking to three other pages exploring some of my interests: books, games, and music. Books is a list of books I've recently read, with their pictures and summaries. Games are some of my favorite games, with pics and gifs of units. Music are some cool songs I've listened to, with the youtube videos embedded</p>
