This is a repository corresponding to the projects outlined in my CV. It is divided into two folders:

<h3>AI: Projects related to artificial intelligence and machine learning</h3>

**Shopping.py**: Built a K-Neighbors classifier using Sklearn to predict if a user will make a purchase on an e-commerce page based on 18 evidence labels. Based on the data set of Sakar et al. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-018-3523-0

**Traffic.py**: Using TensorFlow to build an image classification neural network for traffic sign recoginition. Uses the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news

**Attention.py**: Using Google’s transformer based BERT language model to predict a masked word in a sentence. Also generated a jpg to allow for visualization of each attention head. Implemented using PyTorch and Transformers libraries.



<h3>FullStack: Projects related to full stack web development</h3>

**Finance**: Website which allows user to create account on a fictional stock strading platform. Keeps track of the user’s account, balance, and current holdings. Real time stock values are obtained by using the IEX API. (Does not currently work, I used a 30 day free trial during development).

**Homepage:** A Homepage describing myself and some interests of mine. Built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Birthdays**: Webpage demonstrating full stack concepts. Allows insert, modify, delete a list of birthdays in a database. Uses Flask library.
